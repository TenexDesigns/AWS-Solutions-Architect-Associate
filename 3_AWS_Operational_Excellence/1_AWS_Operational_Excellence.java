The AWS services you mentioned are integral to achieving operational excellence in the AWS cloud environment. Here's an overview of each service and how they contribute to operational excellence:

1. **CloudFormation**: AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables you to define and provision AWS infrastructure and applications in a declarative manner. You can use templates to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, making it easier to standardize, automate, and version control your infrastructure.

   - **How it helps**: CloudFormation helps you achieve operational excellence by automating infrastructure deployment, ensuring consistency, and simplifying resource management.

2. **CodeCommit**: AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that makes it easy for teams to host secure and scalable Git repositories. It's a place to store your application code and collaborate on software development.

   - **How it helps**: CodeCommit promotes operational excellence by providing a secure and collaborative environment for code storage and version control, which is essential for software development and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

3. **Lambda**: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can use it to execute code in response to events and build serverless applications.

   - **How it helps**: Lambda enables operational excellence by allowing you to run code in a scalable, event-driven manner, which simplifies application development and reduces operational overhead.

4. **AWS Config**: AWS Config is a service that provides a detailed view of your AWS resource configurations and how they change over time. It helps assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.

   - **How it helps**: AWS Config promotes operational excellence by enabling you to monitor and manage the configurations of your AWS resources to maintain compliance and security.

5. **CloudWatch**: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms. It provides insights into resource utilization and application performance.

   - **How it helps**: CloudWatch enhances operational excellence by helping you monitor the health and performance of your AWS resources, which enables proactive problem resolution and resource optimization.

6. **Logs**: In AWS, logging services like AWS CloudTrail, AWS CloudWatch Logs, and others help you collect, store, and analyze log data generated by your AWS resources and applications.

   - **How it helps**: Logs support operational excellence by providing a means to track and troubleshoot issues, monitor security, and gain insights into application behavior.

7. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: AWS SNS is a fully managed notification service that can send messages and notifications to a large number of recipients, including individuals, systems, and other AWS services.

   - **How it helps**: SNS contributes to operational excellence by allowing you to set up and automate notifications and alerts, helping you stay informed about the status and events of your AWS resources.

8. **Athena**: Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It provides a way to query and analyze data without the need to set up and manage complex data infrastructure.

   - **How it helps**: Athena promotes operational excellence by simplifying data analysis and reducing the operational overhead of setting up and maintaining data processing pipelines.

Operational excellence is one of the key pillars of AWS's Well-Architected Framework, and these services play a crucial role in achieving that goal. They help automate and streamline various aspects of your AWS environment, improving efficiency, reducing operational overhead, and enabling best practices in infrastructure management and application development.
