**AWS VGW (Virtual Private Gateway)**

An AWS VGW is a device that provides routing between your on-premises network and your AWS VPC. It is a highly available and scalable device that can support a wide range of VPN technologies, including IPsec, SSL/TLS, and L2TP/IPsec.

**Routing methods**

There are two main routing methods that you can use to connect your on-premises network to your AWS VPC:

* **Static routes:** Static routes are manually configured routes that tell your router to send traffic to your AWS VPC through a specific gateway.
* **Dynamic routes:** Dynamic routes are automatically configured routes that are exchanged between your router and your AWS VGW.

**Tunnel configurations**

You can configure your VPN connection to use a variety of different tunnel types, including:

* **IPsec tunnels:** IPsec tunnels are the most common type of VPN tunnel. They use the IPsec suite of protocols to encrypt and authenticate traffic.
* **SSL/TLS tunnels:** SSL/TLS tunnels are another type of VPN tunnel. They use the SSL/TLS suite of protocols to encrypt and authenticate traffic.
* **L2TP/IPsec tunnels:** L2TP/IPsec tunnels are a combination of L2TP and IPsec that provides a secure VPN connection.

**Network architect for custom set up**

If you need to set up a custom VPN connection, you can use the AWS Network Architect tool. The AWS Network Architect tool allows you to create a visual representation of your network topology and to configure your VPN connection using a variety of different options.

**Traffic engineering**

Traffic engineering is the process of optimizing the flow of traffic through your network. You can use traffic engineering to improve the performance and reliability of your VPN connection.

**AWS System Management Console**

The AWS System Management Console is a web-based console that allows you to manage your AWS resources. You can use the AWS System Management Console to set up and manage your VPN connection.

**How the AWS System Management Console creates auto configuration for most VPN devices**

The AWS System Management Console can create auto configurations for most VPN devices by using the device's vendor-specific information. The AWS System Management Console will automatically detect the device's vendor and model, and it will then use this information to configure the VPN connection.

**How to monitor the status of VPN tunnels with CloudWatch**

You can use CloudWatch to monitor the status of your VPN tunnels. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and insights to help you monitor your AWS resources and applications.

To monitor the status of your VPN tunnels with CloudWatch, you can create a CloudWatch alarm. A CloudWatch alarm will notify you if the status of your VPN tunnels changes.

**How to set up a VPN in AWS**

To set up a VPN in AWS, you will need to:

1. Create a VPN connection in the AWS Management Console.
2. Install a VPN client on your device.
3. Connect to your AWS VPC using the VPN connection.

Here are the steps on how to create a VPN connection in the AWS Management Console:

1. Go to the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Console.
2. In the navigation pane, click VPN Connections.
3. Click Create VPN Connection.
4. Select the type of VPN connection you want to create.
5. Enter the necessary information for the VPN connection.
6. Click Create VPN Connection.

Once you have created a VPN connection, you can install a VPN client on your device and connect to your AWS VPC using the VPN connection.

I hope this helps!
