**Storage in AWS**

AWS offers a variety of storage services to meet the needs of different applications and workloads. These services include volatile storage, non-volatile storage, block storage, object storage, and file storage.

**Volatile storage**

Volatile storage is a type of storage that loses its data when the power is turned off. This type of storage is typically used to store temporary data, such as the contents of a cache.

**Examples of volatile storage in AWS:**

* Amazon Elastic Cache
* Amazon MemoryDB

**Non-volatile storage**

Non-volatile storage is a type of storage that retains its data even when the power is turned off. This type of storage is typically used to store persistent data, such as databases, operating systems, and applications.

**Examples of non-volatile storage in AWS:**

* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

**Block storage**

Block storage is a type of storage that provides access to data in blocks of fixed size. Block storage is typically used to store operating systems, databases, and applications.

**Examples of block storage in AWS:**

* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* Amazon EC2 Instance Store

**Object storage**

Object storage is a type of storage that stores data as objects. Objects are self-contained units of data that have a unique identifier. Object storage is typically used to store large amounts of data, such as logs, images, and videos.

**Examples of object storage in AWS:**

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
* Amazon Glacier

**File storage**

File storage is a type of storage that stores data in a hierarchical file system. File storage is typically used to store documents, images, and videos.

**Examples of file storage in AWS:**

* Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

**Pros and cons of each**

**Block storage**

* Pros: High performance, low latency, durable, scalable
* Cons: Can be expensive, complex to manage

**Object storage**

* Pros: Inexpensive, scalable, easy to manage
* Cons: Not as performant as block storage, not ideal for storing data that needs to be accessed frequently

**File storage**

* Pros: Easy to use, familiar file system interface
* Cons: Not as scalable as object storage, can be expensive

**When and why are these services used?**

**Block storage** is typically used to store operating systems, databases, and applications. Block storage provides high performance and low latency, which is important for these workloads.

**Object storage** is typically used to store large amounts of data, such as logs, images, and videos. Object storage is inexpensive and scalable, making it ideal for storing these types of data.

**File storage** is typically used to store documents, images, and videos. File storage is easy to use and provides a familiar file system interface.

**Performance problems around block storage**

One of the main performance problems with block storage is that it can be slow to read and write data to disk. This is because block storage is typically accessed using a file system, which adds overhead.

Another performance problem with block storage is that it can be difficult to scale. This is because block storage is typically provisioned in fixed-size volumes. If you need more storage, you need to create a new volume.

**Why can't we use object storage for attaching into a system?**

Object storage is designed for storing large amounts of data, not for attaching to a system. Object storage is not as performant as block storage, and it does not provide a file system interface.

**Storage are network-attached storage (NAS) and datacenter technology**

NAS is a type of storage that is attached to a network. NAS devices are typically used to store files and other shared data.

Datacenter technology is the hardware and software that is used to power data centers. Datacenter technology includes servers, storage devices, and networking equipment.

**Data lake**

A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format, without being processed in advance. Data lakes are used to store data from a variety of sources, such as sensors, social media, and web logs.

Data lakes are typically accessed using big data analytics tools. These tools allow you to analyze the data to gain insights and make informed decisions.

I hope this helps!
