Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are used to control traffic at the subnet level in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). They act as a security layer that operates at the network level to allow or deny traffic based on rules you define. Here's an example of how to create and configure NACLs in AWS using AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) commands:

**1. Create a NACL:**
To create a new NACL, use the `create-network-acl` command. Replace `your-vpc-id` with the actual VPC ID.

```bash
aws ec2 create-network-acl --vpc-id your-vpc-id
```

**2. Create Inbound and Outbound Rules:**
You can define rules to control inbound and outbound traffic. Here's an example of creating a rule to allow HTTP traffic (port 80):

```bash
# Create an inbound rule to allow HTTP traffic (port 80)
aws ec2 create-network-acl-entry --network-acl-id your-nacl-id --ingress --rule-number 100 --protocol tcp --rule-action allow --port-range From=80,To=80 --cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0

# Create an outbound rule to allow HTTP traffic (port 80)
aws ec2 create-network-acl-entry --network-acl-id your-nacl-id --egress --rule-number 100 --protocol tcp --rule-action allow --port-range From=80,To=80 --cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0
```

**3. Associate NACL with Subnet:**
To apply the NACL to a specific subnet, you need to associate it with the subnet. Replace `your-nacl-id` and `your-subnet-id` with the actual NACL ID and subnet ID.

```bash
aws ec2 replace-network-acl-association --association-id your-association-id --network-acl-id your-nacl-id
```

**4. Verify NACL Configuration:**
You can list the NACL rules to verify the configuration:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-network-acls --network-acl-ids your-nacl-id
```

Keep in mind that the example provided is very basic, and NACL rules can become more complex depending on your security requirements. You can use various options with `aws ec2 create-network-acl-entry` to define rules that meet your specific needs.

It's important to carefully plan and document your NACL rules to ensure the desired level of security for your AWS VPC. Additionally, consider security groups at the instance level for fine-grained control over traffic.

  Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are a firewall that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic for your EC2 instances. You can use NACLs to restrict access to your EC2 instances to only the resources that they need to communicate with.

NACLs can be used to control traffic at the subnet level or at the instance level. If you apply an NACL to a subnet, it will apply to all of the EC2 instances in that subnet. If you apply an NACL to an EC2 instance, it will override any NACLs that are applied to the subnets that the instance is in.

NACLs are made up of rules. Each rule specifies a protocol, port range, CIDR block, and action. The action can be either allow or deny.

To create an NACL, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.

Here is a code sample for creating an NACL using the AWS CLI:

```
aws ec2 create-network-acl --vpc-id vpc-id
```

This will create a new NACL in your VPC.

To add a rule to an NACL, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.

Here is a code sample for adding a rule to an NACL using the AWS CLI:


aws ec2 create-network-acl-rule --network-acl-id nacl-id --rule-number 100 --protocol tcp --port-range 80-80 --cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --action allow


This will add a rule to the NACL that allows all incoming TCP traffic on port 80 from any IP address.

To apply an NACL to a subnet, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.

Here is a code sample for applying an NACL to a subnet using the AWS CLI:

```
aws ec2 associate-network-acl --network-acl-id nacl-id --subnet-id subnet-id
```

This will associate the NACL with the subnet.

To apply an NACL to an EC2 instance, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.

Here is a code sample for applying an NACL to an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI:

```
aws ec2 associate-network-acl --network-acl-id nacl-id --instance-id instance-id
```

This will associate the NACL with the EC2 instance.

NACLs can be used to improve the security of your AWS environment by restricting access to your EC2 instances to only the resources that they need to communicate with.

Here are some additional tips for using NACLs:

* Use NACLs to control traffic at the subnet level. This is more efficient than applying NACLs to individual EC2 instances.
* Use NACLs to restrict access to your EC2 instances to only the resources that they need to communicate with. This can help to improve the security of your AWS environment.
* Use NACLs to allow traffic from specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. This can be useful for allowing traffic from your on-premises network or from other AWS accounts.
* Use NACLs to deny traffic from specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. This can be useful for blocking traffic from malicious sources.

By following these tips, you can use NACLs to improve the security of your AWS environment.
