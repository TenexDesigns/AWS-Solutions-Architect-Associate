When it comes to selecting the best storage solution for a database application in AWS, several factors, including data volume, performance requirements, durability, and budget, should be considered. AWS offers various storage options, each with its own strengths. Here are some of the commonly used storage solutions for database applications:

1. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**:
   - RDS provides managed database services for various relational database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
   - It offers high availability, automated backups, and the option to scale compute and storage independently.
   - RDS is suitable for applications that require a relational database and ACID compliance.

2. **Amazon Aurora**:
   - Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database engine that offers high performance and availability.
   - It is designed for large-scale, high-performance applications and can automatically replicate data across multiple Availability Zones.

3. **Amazon DynamoDB**:
   - DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database that provides fast and predictable performance.
   - It is fully managed, serverless, and scales automatically, making it ideal for applications with variable workloads and high scalability requirements.

4. **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**:
   - EBS provides block storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. You can choose between various volume types, such as General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Throughput Optimized HDD.
   - EBS volumes are often used to store database files when you're running a self-managed database on EC2 instances.

5. **Amazon S3**:
   - While S3 is an object storage service, it can be used for storing database backups, logs, and large binary data.
   - You can use S3 as a cost-effective option for data archiving and backup purposes.

6. **Amazon ElastiCache**:
   - ElastiCache is a managed in-memory caching service that can improve the performance of database applications by caching frequently accessed data.
   - It's commonly used in conjunction with database services like RDS to reduce database load.

The choice of the best storage solution depends on your specific use case and requirements. For relational databases, Amazon RDS and Aurora are strong options. For NoSQL databases and high-demand applications, Amazon DynamoDB can be a great choice. Elastic Block Store (EBS) is useful when you need block-level storage for self-managed database instances on EC2. And for large-scale, high-performance applications, combining different services might be the best approach.

Remember to also consider factors like data encryption, security, backups, and recovery options when designing your database storage solution in AWS.
